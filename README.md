# Afrilang

Afrilang is a lightweight, custom interpreter written in C++ designed for educational and experimental purposes. It aims to provide a simplified syntax and execution model tailored to the needs of beginner programmers and those exploring domain-specific languages.

## 🚀 Features

- Custom syntax parsing and evaluation
- Written entirely in C++
- Easy to build using CMake
- Designed with extensibility in mind

## 📦 Build Instructions

Afrilang uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) to manage the build process.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ferdinaelectro1/Afrilang.git
cd Afrilang
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

This will generate the `afrilang` binary in the `build` directory.

## 📝 Example Usage

```bash
./afrilang examples/hello.afr
```
